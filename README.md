# SE-CraftableItems

Lightweight mod adding craftable food, drinks and vanilla consumables. It is created to work along the "Eat. Drink. Sleep. Repeat!" mod. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2547246713. 

Also big thanks to Bačiulis for for A) creating his SE mods and B) his planter model I am using.


What is included ...

Planters are now a working refinery with recipes:
Gravel => Organic (Organic can be produced in assemblers as well)
Ice    => Cultivated Organic

Survival Kit is now having consumables category, allowing base necesities to be created anywhere.

Most items from this mod and from E.D.S.R! are now available for purchase from dispenser block.

Consumables (assuming this mod is loaded after E.D.S.R!)
